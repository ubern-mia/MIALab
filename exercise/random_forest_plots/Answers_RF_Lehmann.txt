    Effect of tree depth:
    
	- Already above 90% with little depth
	- Separating "line" changes increase, i assume its the DoF


    Effect of the number of trees:
    
	- More shaded areas, i assume it's like the overlapping of all different threes. (red if all overlapp)
	- Something like confidence region


    Parameter tuning:
    
	- Seems to converge aroung 10 threes with depth of 20
