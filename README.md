# Medical Image Analysis Laboratory 2017

Welcome to the medical image analysis laboratory (MIALab) 2017.
This repository contains all code you will need to get started with medical image analysis.

During the MIALab you will work on the task of brain tumor segmentation from MR images.
We have set up an entire pipeline to solve this task, specifically:

- Pre-processing
- Registration
- Feature extraction
- Voxel-wise tissue classification using a decision forest
- Post-processing
- Evaluation

During the laboratory you will team up in groups of 2-3 students and investigate one of these pipeline elements in-depth (see [experiments](experiments.md)).
You will get to know and to use various libraries and software tools needed in the daily life as biomedical engineer in the medical image analysis domain (see [tools](tools.md)).
Note the [syllabus](syllabus.md) for a rough plan of the next 14 weeks and deadlines.

Enjoy!
