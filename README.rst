Medical Image Analysis Laboratory
=================================

Welcome to the medical image analysis laboratory (MIALab).
This repository contains all code you will need to get started with classical medical image analysis.

During the MIALab you will work on the task of brain tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images (see `data <docs/data.rst>`_).
We have set up an entire pipeline to solve this task, specifically:

- Pre-processing
- Registration
- Feature extraction
- Voxel-wise tissue classification
- Post-processing
- Evaluation

During the laboratory you will team up in groups of 2-3 students and investigate one of these pipeline elements in-depth (see `experiments <docs/experiments.rst>`_).
You will get to know and to use various libraries and software tools needed in the daily life as biomedical engineer in the medical image analysis domain (see `tools <docs/tools.rst>`_).

Enjoy!
