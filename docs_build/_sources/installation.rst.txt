.. _installation_initial_steps_label:

Initial Steps
-------------
These steps need to be performed for all operating systems.

#. Create a `Github account <https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home>`_
   (The free account is sufficient).

#. Fork the MIALab repository

   -  Go to the `MIALab repository <https://github.com/ubern-mia/MIALab>`_
   -  Fork the MIALab repository by clicking on the `Fork` button in the right upper corner
   -  Follow the instructions of Github
   -  Go to your MIALab fork (You are at the right location if the text in the left upper corner is of structure `[yourgithubaccount] / MIALab`)
   -  Click on the green `Clone` button and copy the URL (:bash:`https://github.com/[yourgithubaccount]/MIALab.git`) shown. You will later use it for cloning your fork to your local machine and probably to UBELIX.

#. Continue with the operating system specific installation instructions
